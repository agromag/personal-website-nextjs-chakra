## Face-to-face interviews

Given the fact that the sector we are addressing in this project is quite small, the number of people willing to give an interview was quite small. For this reason, we managed to find only one person interested in this aspect and who would also accept the recording of the discussion.
After discussing with a few interested persons, we have extracted the following aspects as the most relevant for our solution:

We have extracted the following aspects as the most relevant for our solution:

\- Q: What are the most important aspects of agriculture?<br/>
\- A: People to be good or willing to learn, good equipment otherwise the investments are higher

\- Q: What are some things that can help a farmer to grow? <br/>
\- A: European funds for farm modernization<br/>
=> Good equipment => higher profit => higher salaries => better people

\- Q: What is the biggest shortcoming you feel at the moment as a farmer? <br/>
\- A: People are hard to find, so look for young people, keep them in the company, pay them well for morale and teach them to do quality work, attention, involvement <br/>
=> To find labor, position the farm near the communes and approach the youth who remained in the village. Mainly heard, and if the man has potential, he rises in the hierarchy. Instead, for engineers, people with education are interested in the workforce or the faculty of agronomy <br/>
=> It's full of frivolous people who don't come to work or do bad work

\- Q: If you could change anything in agriculture, what would you change? <br/>
\- A: Education. In college, the information provided is outdated, useless at the moment. One learns about old equipment or botany researched decades ago, not adapted to current treatments and crops

\- Q: Where do you get information that can help you in your work? <br/>
\- A: Retailers who sell products, do research that presents the products. The proof of quality comes from the control test - the new product vs. the old product. This way you discover better products every year. Farmers are willing to try new products, they are malleable

\- Q: Do you use your phone as a tool for your work? <br/>
\- A: The agricultural field is extremely complex, as you can't know everything, you search the internet for all kinds of information. A weed you don't know, a disease, a parasite. Different recommendations to develop the culture

\- Q: What is the last thing you did on the phone for this purpose? <br/>
\- A: He was looking for wheat treatments, what new products have come out => Very good documenting tool

\- Q: Working with suppliers or other farmers seems like an important part of your job. How does such a collaboration work in general? <br/>
\- A: There is a county association of producers, and the farms sign up for an auction for various products. After a supplier wins the auction, the farmer is obliged to sign a contract and buy the stock. For sure, warranty contracts can be made, but the vast majority are known and no longer resort to this measure. If there is something urgent, call several suppliers and choose the best price <br/>
=> There is a risk of non-compliance, either the farmer does not pay, or the supplier offers a product of poorer quality, or in smaller quantities or does not deliver on time <br/>
=> There are ways to counter - the supplier has a promissory note that blocks the farmer's accounts until payment is made, but the farmer can call on the environment, BUT if the delivery is delayed, he has nothing to do <br/>
=> If you can't afford to work with large, reliable suppliers, environmental protection protects you from expired products, but not from delayed delivery. The only way to solve the problem of delay is by stipulating penalties in the contract, but this mention rarely exists in contracts.

\- Q: What do you do when all your land is used, until the time of harvest? <br/>
\- A: Check the culture phase, if they are diseases, but the equipment is pulled to the right and maintenance is done (checks, shifts, etc.) <br/>
=> He is not willing to give them to strangers. It is risky, and the eventuality of a machine failure can be more costly than the profit of a loan <br/>
=> However, there are loans if there is a trust factor (among friends, acquaintances)

\- Q: Are there exchanges / loans of resources between farmers? If so, how is it done and how safe is this process? <br/>
\- A: There are exchanges between friends, help with people or equipment, but do not work for third parties
