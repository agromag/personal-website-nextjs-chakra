## Target Market

Regarding Agromag, the target market consists exclusively of Romanian farmers, our application being intended to facilitate the processes carried out in this sector. The total number of farmers in Romania this year is estimated at about 4.3 million (a percentage of 23% of the total population of the country), but because we are talking about a mobile application that includes an online payment process, we must address people who have access to smartphones, can handle modern technologies and have a debit card to make these payments. From this point of view, we consider that our target audience consists, on one hand of people who own large and medium-sized farms and, on the other hand, of independent farmers, estimating a total of 1.5 million people.

## Competitors

For our targeted market, the number of main competitors is 5, these being: OLX, lajumate.ro, anunturi-agricole.ro, Bizoo and agricultura-romaneasca.ro. In the case of competitors with a huge market share, we take into account the fact that they are not niches in the field of agriculture, so the market share in their case will fluctuate quite a bit in value.

With a total of over 5000 ads published, the website is based on a concept similar to that of the Agromag application, because it offers the possibility to publish and search for any kind of ad in the agricultural field, from renting, selling, buying equipment, resources or animals, up to the need for workforce. Although it provides details for contacting the person who posted the ad, the site does not facilitate the successful communication and performance of services between 2 users, not assuming responsibility for the published content. Analysing the user interactions with this page, we noticed that for a promoted ad the maximum number of hits was 35,000 people, while for a simple ad, the average value is about 3500 views.

A competitor is also considered the olx.ro site, having at the same time a mobile version of the application. Here users frequently post ads of any kind, being quite familiar with the platform. Market share estimation would be difficult to achieve, because the content published on this platform is extremely diverse, and from the huge number of users it is quite difficult to separate the public interested only from the agricultural sector.

A third possible competition is the Agricultura Romaneasca page, an initiative started in 2009, which is addressed to farmers who want to find out new information about this sector of activity, but also to publish various ads. Although their perspective is close to that of Agromag, we consider that we are distinguished from them by the fact that we want to integrate the possibility to request and offer workforce and similar services, not just renting resources. The market share could not be estimated in the case of this competitor either, because the number of users is not quantified by the owners.

Lajumate.ro is an online advertising platform launched by Intact Media Group in October 2015, which aims to facilitate the sale-purchase process among all internet users in Romania. This site, also having a mobile application developed, is a direct competitor, posting numerous ads in the field of agriculture. The disadvantage of this platform over Agromag is the lack of orientation towards a specific field.

Bizoo is an online platform that offers the possibility of posting ads in many fields, including ads for the agriculture industry. The main categories of ads on this site are related to agriculture, food and beverages, packaging and paper, cars, boats, vehicles, office supplies, home and garden, etc.

## Market share for competitors

To determinate the market share of the competition we use as reference the number of unique users in a month. The total number of usersis indicative, as some of them can use multiple platforms in parallel. These are the statistics for the biggest competitors:

## Potential market share for 5 years

In the first year, we are looking forward to get 0.1% of the current market share. The next year, through good feedback and numerous ads, we aim to get on our platform another 0.5% of active users. Following years, we estimate a exponential growth.

## Total market value

Our application can generate revenue from the following: Promoting ads, Post more than 3 ads (the first 3 are free) or Obtaining a percentage of the cost of a published service. For Agromag, the main sources will come from the promotion of ads, the publication of more than 3 ads, but also the percentage obtained from the value of the service. We estimate to have a profit of 500 RON per month, accumulating 6000 RON in the first year obtained from the promotion of the ads; another gain from the publication of a number of more than 3 ads worth 460 RON per month, accumulating 5520 RON in the first year and a gain of 500 RON per month obtained from the percentage of services, reaching 6000 RON.
