## MVP

In order to see the impact of our product on the target market, we have built a simple **mobile application** that will implement the basic functionalities of the solution we thought of.
For the moment, the application is able to perform the following functions:

- Create a user account
- Login to personal account
- View an ad list
- Access the details of an ad
- Post a new ad

Here is a small preview of the AGROMAG App:

## First Sale

The Agromag MVP was built by the team's developers, being only a small part of the final product. For this reason, in order to be able to validate our solution and to be able to obtain feedback from potential customers and users, we resorted to the following measures:

- The application was designed on the personal laptops of the programmers in the team, not being physically distributed to users
- The people approached during the interview sessions were contacted again in order to be presented with the product designed by the team
- Due to the current pandemic context, we could not meet directly with potential users, so through calls on Zoom / Teams they were presented the first features of the product
- The farmers contacted were interested in the solution presented and said they would be interested to see the online payment features that would make the exchange of services much more secure
