## MVP

In order to see the impact of our product on the target market, we have built a simple mobile application that will implement the basic functionalities of the solution we thought of.
For the moment, the application is able to perform the following functions:

- Create a user account
- Login to personal account
- View an ad list
- Access the details of an ad
- Post a new ad

Here is a small preview of the AGROMAG App:
