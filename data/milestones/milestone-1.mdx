## Problem
Currently, Romania has an agricultural area of 14.8 million hectares, of which only ten million are occupied by arable land. However, agriculture in Romania represents 5% of the GDP and it engages about 30% of the country's active population. Taking into account these well-known aspects, we identified this field of the economy as a **vulnerable** one, because the Romanian citizens who own agricultural land or equipment **do not take full advantage of their resources**. Uncultivated land plots and unused equipment, as well as failure to adopt modern techniques, annually influence the agricultural sector.

## Solution

Our team brings to the fore an application designed to **improve the quality of services in the agricultural field**. The Agromag solution aims to facilitate communication between stakeholders, offering users the opportunity to distribute ads and connect with other entities interested in providing various services. Starting from the rental of agricultural equipment and arable land and continuing with the possibility of finding workers, our platform addresses exclusively the agricultural sector, having as its main goal the full exploitation of resources and the improvement of an important sector of the Romanian economy.

---

## Customer Segment

Being a **B2B application**, our solution is addressed, on the one hand, to companies that own agricultural land or equipment that they want to offer for rent and, on the other hand, to companies that need such resources or labor force for carrying out various activities in the agricultural field.
